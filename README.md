#### 1. Download the project from [releases](https://github.com/0Xiaohei0/LocalAIVtuber/releases)
#### 2. open command prompt in project folder.
  
#### 3. Create environment
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  (If you encounter an error that says â€œcannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Open powershell with admin privilage and run ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```)
  
#### 4. Install packages
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
  pip install llama-cpp-python

  pip install nltk
  python -m nltk.downloader -d C:\nltk_data all
  ```

#### 5. Start Program
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
    When you see this message, go to http://localhost:7860 to see web UI 
    ```
    Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
    To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.
    ```

### Notes: 

#### restarting program

To start the program again, run:
  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
   python main.py
   ```
#### run llm on gpu
If you have a decent GPU, You can install the GPU version of llama-cpp-python:
```
$env:CMAKE_ARGS ="-DGGML_CUDA=ON"
 pip install llama-cpp-python --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --verbose --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/124
```
This can improve latency further.

Just a reminder for someone using Command Prompt instead of Power Shell
Change this
```
$env:CMAKE_ARGS ="-DGGML_CUDA=ON"
```
To this
```
set CMAKE_ARGS=-DGGML_CUDA=ON
```
or it will show error 
```
$env:CMAKE_ARGS ="-DGGML_CUDA=ON"
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
```

## FAQ:

- NameError: name '_in_projection' is not defined

You cannot enable gpt sovits and rvc at the same time, some of their modules have conflict. 

- UnboundLocalError: local variable 'response' referenced before assignment

  If you cloned this repo, you maybe missing model files for gpt-sovits, which will be in the zip folder in the [releases](https://github.com/0Xiaohei0/LocalAIVtuber/releases) section. 
  replace plugins\gpt_sovits\models with the one from the zip.
- To fetch chat from Youtube, copy the youtube_video_id from the stream url like this:
